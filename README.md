# TransparencyPortal: Enhancing Access to Public Contract Data in Portugal


### Project Description:

This project addresses the pressing need for accessible information on public contracts in Portugal. Public contracts form a crucial part of government expenditure and procurement, vital for transparency, accountability, and analysis by stakeholders like researchers, policymakers, journalists, and the public.

However, the scattered nature of information sources, differing formats, and limited accessibility pose significant challenges for accessing and analyzing public contract data. Our solution consolidates and presents this data in a structured, accessible manner.

The dataset provided on our platform includes key features such as contract ID, type, contracting authority, contractors, publication date, and contract value. Organized effectively, users can derive insights into government spending, procurement trends, contractor performance, and regulatory compliance.

Our project aims to facilitate informed decision-making, enhance transparency, and bolster accountability in public spending. By supporting research and analysis on government contracts, we aspire to contribute to better governance and public service delivery in Portugal.
